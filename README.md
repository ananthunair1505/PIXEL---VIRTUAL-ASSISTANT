## Requirements
The first and foremost thing for an A.I. assistant is that it should be able to speak. To make our virtual assistant talk, we will make a function. This function will take audio as an argument, and then it will pronounce it.

Now, the next thing we need is audio. We must supply audio so that we can pronounce it using the speak function we made. We are going to install a module called pyttsx3.



### OS Requirements
Operation system: Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)
Python Version: 3.8.x



### What is pyttsx3?
A python library that will help us to convert text to speech. In short, it is a text-to-speech library.
It works offline, and it is compatible with Python 2 as well as Python 3.


```python
$ pip install pyttsx3
```

The next most important thing for our A.I. assistant is that it should take command with the help of the microphone of the user's system. So, now we will make a take Command function.  With the help of the take Command function, our A.I. assistant will return a string output by taking microphone input from the user.



## Note:
``
Do not forget to 'enable the less secure apps' feature in your Gmail account. Otherwise, the automatic send Email function will not work properly.
